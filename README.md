## Hidden Multiple Comparison Trap Simulations
This repository includes R code used for the manuscript "The multiple-comparison trap and the Raven's paradox -- Perils of using null hypothesis testing" currently under review.

This folder includes simulation R code `PerilSims.R` and data files:

- Data from Baker and King (2010)

  1. `Glades.env.txt` – TP concentration, row names represent sites;
  2. `Glades.taxa.txt` – Macroinvertebrate counts, each column represent a taxon, row names represent sites;
- Data from Qian et al. (2003)

  3.  `InvertbratesGeomeansUPT6mo.csv` – macroinvertebrates data; the column of BCD is used in the simulation
  4. `Macroinv.tolerance.csv` – percent tolerant taxa
